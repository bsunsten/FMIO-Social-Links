## My process

This project was a good test of my former CSS knowledge. I initially began the layout using flexbox, but have been attempting to utilize the `<main>` tag for accessibilty, which led to working around nested flexboxes. I was suggested to use CSS Grid instead, which turned out to be easier! I also utilized the Figma designs this time to get more accurate CSS values. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned quite a bit working on this page! I learned how to set custom CSS variables using `:root`, which was helpful with reusing colors. I also feel like I have a better understanding of when to use flexbox and how to space things properly, especially using the `gap` attribute.. Beyond just code, I also gained some practice incorporating values from Figma designs to make things more accurate.

### Continued development

I want to continue working from Figma designs now, it was really helpful for making things like border radii accurate to the design. 


### AI Collaboration

I utilized Claude code for some of the spacing and suggestions for improvements on my design. An example of this was learning that `<ul>` elements have a default left-padding of 40px, or expanding the width of my `<a>` links to the full width of the containing list elements.
